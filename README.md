> *Learning Flutter: chapter VI*

This project was build following a [Flutter & Dart Course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). The main learning focus in this section is the integration with main **Firebase** functionalities.

I've been writing some notes while building the app. Here they are.

# Setting Up a Firebase project
